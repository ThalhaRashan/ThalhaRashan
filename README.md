# Hi, I'm Thalha Rashan 👋

**Backend Engineer & Mathematician | Data Systems Specialist**

I sit at the intersection of **Statistical Mathematics** and **Production Software Engineering**. With **7+ years of experience** in the Clinical Research sector, I specialize in building safety-critical data pipelines, custom Domain Specific Languages (DSLs), and high-fidelity extraction engines for complex medical data.

## 🚀 Featured Engineering Portfolio

I have open-sourced the core architectural patterns of my production systems.

### 1. [The "Variable Engine" (DSL Compiler)](https://github.com/ThalhaRashan/dataset-variable-mapper)
**Type:** Compiler Design / Core Logic
A custom Domain Specific Language (DSL) built to replace fragile Python scripts with safe, SQL-like transformations.
*   **Tech:** Abstract Syntax Trees (AST), Recursive Descent Parsers, Pandas Vectorization, GitHub Actions (CI/CD).
*   **Why it matters:** Implements strict type-checking and a recursive executor to prevent arbitrary code execution while maintaining performance.

### 2. [PDF Data Extraction Engine](https://github.com/ThalhaRashan/RAG_ingestion)
**Type:** Data Engineering / ETL
A production-grade ingestion engine engineered for messy clinical PDFs.
*   **Tech:** Docling, PyTorch (CUDA), Custom Layout Analysis, MD5 Governance.
*   **Key Feature:** Solves the "Ghost Column" and "Table Splitting" issues common in standard extraction tools using custom heuristics and layout-aware parsing.

### 3. [Clinical Intelligence API](https://github.com/ThalhaRashan/AI_chat_assistant)
**Type:** Backend / Microservices
The inference layer that serves the extraction engine.
*   **Tech:** Flask, Redis, Nginx, Docker Compose.
*   **Key Feature:** Implements "Parent-Child" retrieval strategies and secure environment configuration patterns.
